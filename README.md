# Open_Genius_For_YoutubeMusic
This script automatically opens a Genius lyrics page based on the current YouTube Music tab. If you switch to another song, the existing Genius tab updates to show the new lyrics.

Unlike other YouTube-Genius scripts that automatically match Genius page based on Youtube video title
  1. which often leads to incorrect Genius lyrics becasue there are so many songs with the same names.
  2. they can't work on cover songs.

This script ensures accuracy by using a predefined mapping list ([videoID_To_GeniusURL.csv](https://github.com/188751671/Open_Genius_For_YoutubeMusic/blob/main/videoID_To_GeniusURL.csv) that record both Youtbe and Genius URLs' slugs and is where the script read from.

Tip: Because the lyrics is on a seperate tab, you can put it on your second screen while watching the video in fullscreen.
